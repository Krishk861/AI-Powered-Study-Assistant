📚 AI-Powered Study Assistant

The AI-Powered Study Assistant is an intelligent learning tool designed to help students study more efficiently using modern AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of manually searching through long PDFs or lecture notes, users can upload their study materials and ask questions in natural language to get clear, accurate answers.

This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which means the assistant retrieves relevant information directly from the user’s uploaded documents before generating a response. By grounding answers in the provided content, the system reduces hallucinations and ensures that responses stay relevant to what the student is actually studying.

The assistant is especially useful for exam preparation, quick revision, and understanding complex topics. It allows students to interact with their notes like a conversation, saving time and making learning more engaging. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how AI can be applied responsibly in education to act as a supportive learning companion rather than a replacement for traditional study methods.
